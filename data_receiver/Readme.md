\***\*p, err := kafka.NewProducer(&kafka.ConfigMap{"bootstrap.servers": "localhost"})
if err != nil {
panic(err)
}\*\***
defer p.Close()
What it does:
Initializes a Kafka producer to send messages to a Kafka topic.
The bootstrap.servers configuration specifies the Kafka broker address (in this case, localhost).
Why needed:
This service needs to send the received GPS data to a Kafka topic for other services to consume and process.
